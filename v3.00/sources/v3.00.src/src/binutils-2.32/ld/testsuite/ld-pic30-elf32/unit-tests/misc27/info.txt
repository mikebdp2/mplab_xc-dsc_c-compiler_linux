Misc27: Correct encoding of BFINSF,BFEXTF instructions:

The objective of this test is to verify that
the bitfield instructions are correctly encoded.

Note: Uses device GENERIC-16DSP-CH and a copy
of linker script p33CK64MP508.gld.

The compiled program is executed via the
simulator and correct output is verified.

How to execute the test:

1. Set the environment variable $PIC30_CD
    to your pic30 tools binary directory
2. Export $PIC30_CD
3. Edit the Configuration section of file "go"
4. Execute "go"

To get verbose output:

Execute "go -v"
