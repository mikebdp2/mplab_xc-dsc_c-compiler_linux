lkr035: ALIGN(), NEXT() in general expressions (SSR# 21589):

The objective of this test is to verify that
the ALIGN() and NEXT() functions can be used in 
general expressions together with a specified
region. Previously, the region was ignored.

For binutils-v2.32, this test was updated to
explicitly reference linker script symbols
in source code, otherwise they would not appear
in the linked output file. Note that such
symbols are defined as "weak"; previous
versions of the linker defined them
as "global".

How to execute the test:

1. Set the environment variable $PIC30_CD
    to your pic30 CD image directory
2. Export $PIC30_CD
3. Execute "go"

To get verbose output:

Execute "go -v"
