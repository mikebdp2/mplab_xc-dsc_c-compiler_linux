lkr057:  Support for attribute MERGE

The objective of this test is to verify that
sections marked with the MERGE attribute are
handled properly by the assembler.

Note: This attribute is not reported by objdump.

XC16 supports this attribute in the assembler only.
There is some related code in the generic linker,
but we don't use it or test it.

How to execute the test:

1. Set the environment variable $PIC30_CD
    to your pic30 tools binary directory
2. Export $PIC30_CD

To get verbose output:

Execute "go -v"
